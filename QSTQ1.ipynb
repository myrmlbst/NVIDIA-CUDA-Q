    "\n",
    "  The basic unit of information in classical computing is a *bit*. A bit stores information by taking on the value (sometimes referred to as a state) of either 0 or 1.  We can use the notation $b=0$ to describe a bit $b$ in the state $0$. One way to visualize this is an arrow (or a unit vector).  If the vector is pointing up, the bit is in the state 0 and if the vector points down, the bit is in the state 1.  Classical computing can change the state of a bit by changing it from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. This operation is known as a bit-flip, and visually looks like flipping the direction of the vector from up to down or vice versa.\n",

    "In quantum computing, instead of bits, information is stored in *qubits*.  While a single bit can only be in one of 2 states at a given time, a single qubit can be in one of infinitely many states! This suggests that we might be able to handle information more efficiently with qubits than we could with bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a catch.  While there are infinitely many quantum states, we can't necessarily access all the information stored in these infinitely many states.  This is due to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Restriciting our focus on how uncertainty arises in quantum computation, let's look at the general structure of a quantum program. Many quantum programs start with initializing a quantum state, manipulating the state, and then measuring it.  When we measure a qubit, the act of measuring can change the quantum state of the qubit. For example, measuring may collapse the quantum state to of a single qubit to one of two classical states (e.g., 0 or 1). Measurement is how we extract useful information from a qubit. We'll explore this idea later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize qubits, we will extend the idea of representing a bit as a unit vector pointing up or down. A qubit, $q$, can be thought of as a unit vector pointing in any direction in 3D.  In other words, we can visualize a qubit as a vector on a sphere. The literature refers to this sphere as the Bloch sphere.  As a generalization of bits, we'll identify the vector pointing up (i.e., in the direction of the positive $z$-axis) with the zero state (see figure below). \n",

    "The zero state is denoted by $\\ket{0}$ and this notation is read as \"ket zero\" or \"zero ket\". The word \"ket\" comes from Dirac notation, which we'll describe in more detail later. The vector pointing down will represent the one state, which is abbreviated as $\\ket{1}$ and referred to as \"ket one\" or \"one ket\". \n",

    "> **Take note:** In order to do any computation, we will need a mechanism for changing the state of a qubit.  Quantum computing allows us to change the state of a single qubit through quantum operations which can be visualized as rotations of the sphere. We'll explore this in more detail later in this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">**FAQ:** *How does ‘infinitely many states’ with a qubit differ from \"analog computing\"? That is also infinite, no?*  \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer** Qubits can demonstrate the quantum properties of superposition, entanglement, and interference. Additionally, in analog computing, the way in which information is extracted from an analog state differs from what happens in quantum computing.  This is due to the way states are measured and the limitations imposted by the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics.  We'll experiment with measurement and superposition in this notebook. Entanglement and interference are covered in the next notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a visual representation of a qubit, let's establish some notation that will allow us to describe states and carry out quantum operations on these states.  We've already introduced the states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$.  We can identify $\\ket{0}$ with the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\ket{1}$ with the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$.  Then, for the purposes of this tutorial, any other quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$ on the Bloch sphere can be written as a linear combination of $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ .  In other words, quantum states take the form\n",

Quantum kernels are defined as functions that are executed on a quantum processing unit (QPU) or a simulated QPU. Quantum kernels can be combined with classical functions to create quantum-classical applications that can be executed on a heterogeneous system of QPUs, GPUs, and CPUs to solve real-world problems."

    "What is happening when we take a measurement?  What distinguishes the `mz` command from the `mx` command?  Abstractly when we are measuring a state $\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha\\ket{0}+\\beta\\ket{1}$ with `mz`, we are applying Born's rule to the state $\\ket{\\psi}$. This act of measurement will collapse the state to $\\ket{0}$, with a probability $|\\alpha|^2$  and will collapse the state of the qubit to  $\\ket{1}$ with probability $|\\beta|^2$. You can graphically visualize this collapse under a `mz` measurement on the Bloch sphere as projecting the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ onto the $z$ axis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Analogously, when measuring with `mx` we will be collapsing our state $\\ket{\\psi}$ to either $\\ket{+}$ or $\\ket{-}$ along the $x$-axis of the Bloch sphere.  We can use Born's Rule for this measurement, too.  The only difference is now instead of writing $\\ket{\\psi}$ in terms of computational basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, we'll find coefficients $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ so that $\\ket{\\psi}=\\gamma\\ket{+}+\\delta\\ket{-}$. With the `mx`measurement, the probabilities of measuring a $0$ and $1$ are determined by $|\\gamma|^2$ and $|\\delta|^2$, respectively. \n",
    "So for the case of $\\ket{+}$, the probability of measuring $0$ with `mx` is $100\\%$, and for $\\ket{-}$ the probability of measuring a $1$ with `mx` is $100\\%$. Therefore, `mx` gives us a way to distinguish $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ with only one shot, assuming there is no noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this series of labs, we'll only be measuring with `mz`.
